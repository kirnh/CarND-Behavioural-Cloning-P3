# Behaviorial Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This repository contains files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

The project mainly contains five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* writeup_report.md (a report writeup file)
* video.mp4 that can be viewed from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRs7ndJncg4&feature=youtu.be) youtube link (a video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the track for one full lap)

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom.

## Details About using Files In This Directory

The model.h5 and drive.py can be used to drive the car autonomously in the simulator using the following code.

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.
